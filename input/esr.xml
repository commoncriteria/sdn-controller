	<section title="Background and Purpose" id="purpose">
		This document describes a core set of high-level fundamental 
		security requirements expected of any Software Defined Networking
		(SDN) Controller for use in an enterprise. It is intended to 
		provide a minimal, baseline set of requirements which can be built
		upon by future revisions to provide an overall set of security 
		solutions for an enterprise network.
		<p/>
		SDN Controllers are one of many components of an SDN networking 
		architecture. See below diagram.
		<p/>

		/>
		<p/>
		An SDN Controller is a central and vital component of what 
		constitutes an SDN system and is available as a logical or a 
		physical device. An SDN Controller manages and distributes network
		policies, collects routing and payload information from the Data
		Plane, and interfaces with user applications in the Management
		Plane. Each of the planes in an SDN system is composed of multiple
		logical or physical components. SDN Controllers logically 
		centralize the network intelligence and state in the Control 
		Plane. 
		<p/>
		For clarity the following definitions are provided:
		<ul>
			<li>
				The Control Plane is a logical entity that receives 
				instructions or requirements from the SDN Application 
				layer through its northbound interface and relays them to
				the Data Plane through its southbound interface. The 
				Controller extracts information about the network from 
				the Data Plane and communicates back to the SDN 
				Application Layer with an abstract view of the network,
				including statistics and events about what is happening.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Data Plane (or SDN Network Devices) controls the 
				forwarding and data processing capabilities for the 
				network. This includes forwarding and processing of the
				data path.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Management Plane (or SDN Applications Layer) is 
				composed of programs that communicate behaviors and 
				needed resources with the SDN Controller via application
				programming interfaces (APIs). In addition, the 
				applications can build an abstracted view of the network
				by collecting information from the Controller for 
				decision-making purposes. These applications could 
				include networking management, analytics, or business
				applications used to run large data centers. For example,
				an analytics application might be built to recognize 
				suspicious network activity for security purposes. The 
				Management Plane is sometimes also referred to as the 
				Orchestration Layer.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
	  <ul>
	  	<li>
	  		SDN controller as a standalone physical device.
	  	</li>
	  	<li>
	  		SDN controller as a virtual device.
	  	</li>
	  	<li>
	  		SDN Controller (standalone or virtual) with management 
	  		capabilities.
	  	</li>
	  	<li>
	  		A cluster of SDN Controllers (standalone or virtual).
	  	</li>
	  	<li>
	  		The intent is that an SDN Controller satisfying these 
	  		requirements will “do no harm” on a network. Rather than 
	  		providing any explicit security functionality, compliant 
	  		SDN Controllers simply ensure:
	  	</li>
	  	<ul>
	  		<li>
	  			They can be remotely managed in a secure manner.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			Any software/firmware updates are from a trusted source.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			Any interfaces to applications, VMs, and other devices are
	  			trusted (zone of trust).
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			All suspect events are reported.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			Logical or physical separation of the Control and Data 
	  			Planes.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			Logical or physical separation of the Control and Management 
	  			Planes.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			Protect data collected and distributed by the Control Plane
	  			to the Data Plane such as flow tables and configurations.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			Protect data collected and distributed by the Control Plane 
	  			to the Management Plane such as auditable events and 
	  			traffic/packet statistics.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			Protect data collected, distributed and shared within the 
	  			Control Plane such as when multiple SDN controllers exist 
	  			in the architecture.

	<section title="Essential Security Requirements" id="requirements">
		The following are the essential security requirements that are 
		expected to be implemented by an SDN Controller. Note that these
		security requirements are conditional on that functionality being 
		present. For example, an SDN Controller that does not include any
		management functionality is considered to satisfy any security
		requirements that pertain to the secure use of management features.
		<p/>
		Any other conditional requirements that depend on whether or not
		the product implements a certain capability are listed in the
		“Optional Extensions” section below.
		<ul>
			<li>
				The remote administration and audit functions shall use
				cryptography to protect communications.
			</li>
			<li>
				All communications with other SDN components shall be
				protected and authenticated.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall be capable of auditing 
				administrative actions, including any configuration changes
				and rebooting of the SDN Controller.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall provide an authentication mechanism
				for local and remote administrators, as well as the 
				device/VM itself (e.g., the device/VM maintains an 
				authentication credential that can be used to authenticate
				it to an administrator’s client) .
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall provide a cryptographic means to
				validate the source of updates to be installed on the 
				device/VM. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall require any default passwords 
				/ other credentials to be changed upon installation.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall protect keys, key material, and 
				authentication credentials from unauthorized disclosure.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall be robust against malformed 
				network packets, and denial-of-service attacks.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall provide self-tests to ensure the
				security functions it implements are operating correctly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Updates to the SDN Controller shall be authenticated.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section title="Assumptions" id="assumptions">
		<ul>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller relies on a trustworthy computing 
				platform for its execution and it is assumed that the 
				platform has not been compromised prior to the installation
				of the SDN Controller.
			</li>
			<li>
				The administrator of the underlying platform or SDN 
				Controller is not careless, willfully negligent or hostile,
				and administers the software within compliance of the 
				approved enterprise security policy. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Physical security appropriate to the value of the SDN 
				Controller and the data it contains is provided.
			</li>
			<li> 
				An SDN Controller is protected from physical attacks by
				the wider environment.

	<section title="Optional Extensions" id="extensions"> 
		The following requirements may already be realized in some products
		in this technology class, but the ESR is not mandating these 
		capabilities exist in “baseline” level product:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Automatic response to certain security events.
			</li>
			<li>
				Validation of patches and updates intended for data plane 
				SDN Devices - as an add-on to any validation performed in
				the switch and not as an alternative.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<section title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> 
		Requirements specified here specify security-relevant behavior 
		that is not expected to be realized currently in SDN Controllers, 
		but capabilities that may be mandated in future versions of the 
		ESR and resulting cPPs.
		<ul>
			<li>
				The device shall have internal security features to make
				the device more resilient to security breaches. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The device shall provide two-factor authentication 
				natively on the device (i.e., does not rely on a 
				separate device to provide this capability).

	<section title="Outside the TOE's Scope" id="outsidescope">
	    <ul>

				will be specified in other ESRs.
