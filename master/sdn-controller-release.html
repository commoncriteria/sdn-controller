      <span style="" class="comment " id="Comment-1-">Not sure if/how we want to communicate functional package guidance but this is our expectation for what claims can be made:
         <br/>TLS package:<br/> - no restrictions, any claims can be made (FTP_ITC_EXT.1 allows for both TLS and DTLS client and server to be specified) but none are mandatory<br/>
         <br/>SSH package:<br/> - no restrictions, any claims can be made (FTP_ITC_EXT.1 allows for both SSH client and server to be specified) but none are mandatory<br/>
         <br/>X.509 package:<br/> - FIA_XCU_EXT.2 may be claimed because the TOE may need to assert its identity to external entities (i.e. if it implements IPsec or if it implements TLS or DTLS as a server)<br/>
          - FIA_X509_EXT.3 would likely need to be claimed if FIA_XCU_EXT.1 is claimed - it's not technically mandatory but the likely use case is for the TOE to request certs from an external CA. 
          - FIA_X509_EXT.1 must be claimed (it was mandatory in the old PP but the minimum required function is TLS, which isn't actually mandatory, so this may require further examination - right now it is valid to say the TOE implements TLS/DTLS as a server only and then it never actually has to validate a certificate, not sure if this is intended though). CRL or OCSP is expected as the only supported revocation methods. Specific additional guidance may be needed to limit the FIA_X509_EXT.1.3 selections to those values. SME input is needed as to whether any of the other selections in this component are mandatory or forbidden.<br/>
          - FIA_X509_EXT.2 must be claimed (it was mandatory in the old PP<br/>
      Also, right now we don't make an explicit statement in FAU_GEN.1 that the corresponding audit events from the claimed functional package SFRs must also be added to the audit table. Do we need that or is it sufficiently implied?

          The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to describe the security functionality of a Software Defined Networking (SDN) Controller use in an enterprise, and define
          functional and assurance requirements for such products. An SDN is one of many components of an SDN networking architecture. It is intended to provide a minimal, 
          baseline set of requirements which can be built upon by future revisions to provide an overall set of security solutions for an enterprise network. An SDN is also a 
          central and vital component of what constitutes an SDN system and is available as a logical or a physical device. An SDN Controller manages and distributes network
          policies, collects routing and payload information from the Data Plane and interfaces with user applications in the Management Plane. Each of the planes in an SDN 
          system is composed of multiple logical or physical components. SDN Controllers logically centralize the network intelligence and state in the Control Plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          An SDN Controller is meant to 'do no harm' on a network. Rather than providing any explicit security functionality, compliant SDN Controllers simply ensure the
          following.
          <ul>
            <li>
              They can be remotely managed in a secure manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any software or firmware updates are from a trusted source.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any interfaces to applications, VMs, and other devices are trusted (zone of trust).
            </li>
            <li>
               All suspect events are reported.
            </li>
            <li>
               Logical or physical separation of the Control and Data Planes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Logical or physical separation of the Control and Management Planes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Protect data collected and distributed by the Control Plane to the Data Plane, such as flow tables and configurations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Protect data collected and distributed by the Control Plane to the Management Plane, such as auditable events and traffic or packet statistics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Protect data collected that is distributed and shared within the Control Plane, such as when multiple SDN controllers exist in the architecture.

    <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation">1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation</h2> 
      Compliant TOEs will implement security functionality in the following general areas:
      <ul>
        <li>Accountability: ensuring that information exists to discover unintentional issues with the configuration and operation of the TOE so that the root cause can be determined.</li>
        <li>Integrity: ensuring the integrity of updates to the TOE and enforcing mechanisms that control the deployment and execution of applications running on it.</li>
        <li>Management: providing mechanisms for configuration of the TSF and deployment of applications running on the TOE.</li>
        <li>Protected Storage: ensuring that credentials and file system data are not subject to unauthorized disclosure.</li>
        <li>Protected Communications: ensuring that sensitive data in transit to and from the TOE is adequately protected from unauthorized modification and disclosure.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="indexable" data-level="3" id="TOE_Boundary">1.3.1 TOE Boundary</h3>
        The TOE boundary for an SDN Controller is available as a logical or a physical device. An SDN Controller manages and distributes network policies, collects routing

      The Security Objectives in 
       were constructed to address threats identified in
      . The Security Functional Requirements (s)
      in  are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (s) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. <br/> This section lists the set of s from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
       to be performed are specified both in  as well as in this section. <br/> The general model for evaluation of s against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <br/> After the
         has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the
        , supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within , which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in  also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP. As per ASE activities
        defined in .
      The information about the  is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the  portion of the . The  developer must concur with the description of the product that is
        contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The Assurance Activities
        contained in  should provide the  authors with
        sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the TSS section.
          <div class="comp" id=""><h4> Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)</h4>The
          functional specification describes the TSFIs. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because s conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by 
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the  in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

      Testing is specified for functional aspects of
        the system as well as aspects that take advantage of design or implementation weaknesses.
        The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN
        family. At the assurance level specified in this PP, testing is based on advertised
        functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One
        of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the
        following requirements. <div class="comp" id=""><h4> Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)</h4> Testing is performed to confirm the
          functionality described in the  as well as the administrative
          (including configuration and operational) documentation provided. The focus of the testing
          is to confirm that the requirements specified in  being met,
          although some additional testing is specified for SARs in . The
          Assurance Activities identify the additional testing activities associated with these
          components. The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of
          testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the platform/
          combinations that are claiming conformance to this PP. Given the scope of the  and its associated evaluation evidence requirements, this component’s
          assurance activities are covered by the assurance activities listed for ALC_CMC.1.

              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the  and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. <br/> While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the  is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                , the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the  are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the  and its
              platform. <br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.</div></div></div>
      
      For the first generation of
        this protection profile, the evaluation lab is expected to survey open sources to discover
        what vulnerabilities have been discovered in these types of products. In most cases, these
        vulnerabilities will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. Until
        penetration tools are created and uniformly distributed to the evaluation labs, the
        evaluator will not be expected to test for these vulnerabilities in the . The labs will be expected to comment on the likelihood of these vulnerabilities given
        the documentation provided by the vendor. This information will be used in the development
        of penetration testing tools and for the development of future protection profiles.

  <h1 id="satisfiedreqs" class="indexable" data-level="A">Appendix A -  Inherently Satisfied Requirements</h1> This
	appendix lists requirements that should be considered satisfied by products
	successfully evaluated against this Protection Profile.  
	However, these requirements are not featured explicitly as SFRs and should not be

	They are not included as standalone SFRs because it would

	provides evidence that these controls are present and have been evaluated.
    
	
	Requirement
	Rationale for Satisfaction
	
	
	FIA_UAU.1 - Timing of authentication
	
	   implicitly requires that the OS perform all necessary actions, 
	  including those on behalf of the user who has not been authenticated, 
	  in order to authenticate;
	  therefore it is duplicative to include these actions as a 
	  separate assignment and test.
	
	
	
	FIA_UID.1 - Timing of identification
	
	   implicitly requires that the OS perform all necessary actions, 
	  including those on behalf of the user who has not been identified, 
	  in order to authenticate;
	  therefore it is duplicative to include these actions as a 
	  separate assignment and test.
	
	
	
	FMT_SMR.1 - Security roles
	
	   specifies role-based management functions that implicitly defines
	  user and privileged accounts; 
	  therefore, it is duplicative to include separate role requirements.
	
	
	
	FPT_STM.1 - Reliable time stamps
	
	   explicitly requires that the OS associate timestamps with audit records;
	  therefore it is duplicative to include a separate timestamp requirement.
	
	
	
	FTA_SSL.1 - TSF-initiated session locking
	
	   defines requirements for managing session locking;
	  therefore, it is duplicative to include a separate session locking requirement.
	
	
	
	FTA_SSL.2 - User-initiated locking
	
	   defines requirements for user-initiated session locking;
	  therefore, it is duplicative to include a separate session locking requirement.
	
	
	
	FAU_STG.1 - Protected audit trail storage
	
	   defines a requirement to protect audit logs;
	  therefore, it is duplicative to include a separate protection of audit trail requirements.
	
	
	
	FAU_GEN.2 - User identity association
	
	   explicitly requires that the OS record
	  any user account associated with each event; therefore, it is duplicative
	  to include a separate requirement to associate a user account with each
	  event.
	
	
	
	  FAU_SAR.1 - Audit review
	  
	     requires that audit logs (and other objects)
	    are protected from reading by unprivileged users; therefore, it is duplicative

  <h1 id="entropyappendix" class="indexable" data-level="A">Appendix B -  Entropy Documentation and Assessment</h1> This appendix
    describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS. <br/>
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the TSS. <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="entropydesign">B.1 Design Description</h2>
      Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product. <br/> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of
      the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary
      outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <br/> If implemented, the design
      description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included. 
    <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="entropyjustification">B.2 Entropy Justification</h2> There should be a technical
      argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence
      in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by
      this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy. <br/> The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
      depends on the type of entropy source included in the product. <br/> For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output. <br/> For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the
      OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
      documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this
      third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy,
      however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular,
      the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST. <br/>
      Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is
      initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy
      rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of
      entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the
      statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the
      calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete. <br/> The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any
      third-party application or from any state saving between restarts. 
    <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="entropyoperatingconditions">B.3 Operating Conditions</h2> The entropy rate may be
      affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage,
      frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may
      affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. 
    <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="entropyhealthtesting">B.4 Health Testing</h2> More specifically, all entropy source
      health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health
      tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source.
