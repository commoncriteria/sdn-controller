        <h1 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="Introduction">1 Introduction</h1>
        <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="Overview">1.1 Overview</h2>
        <p> The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to describe the security functionality of Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller use in an enterprise, and define functional and assurance requirements for such products. An SDN is one of many components of an SDN networking architecture. It is intended to provide a minimal, baseline set of requirements which can be built upon by future revisions to provide an overall set of security solutions for an enterprise network. An SDN is also a central and vital component of what constitutes an SDN system and is available as a logical or a physical device. An SDN controller manages and distributes network policies, collects routing and payload information from the data plane and interfaces with user applications in the management plane. Each of the planes in an SDN system is composed of multiple logical or physical components. SDN controllers logically centralize the network intelligence and state in the control plane. </p>
        <p>
             An SDN controller is meant to 'do no harm' on a network. Rather than providing any explicit security functionality, compliant SDN controllers ensure the following. 
            <ul>
                <li> They can be remotely managed in a secure manner. </li>
                <li> Any software or firmware updates are from a trusted source. </li>
                <li> Any interfaces to applications, VMs, and other devices are trusted (zone of trust). </li>
                <li> All suspect events are reported. </li>
                <li> Logical or physical separation of the control and data planes. </li>
                <li> Logical or physical separation of the control and management planes. </li>
                <li> Protect data collected and distributed by the control plane to the data plane, such as flow tables and configurations. </li>
                <li> Protect data collected and distributed by the control plane to the management plane, such as auditable events and traffic or packet statistics. </li>
                <li> Protect data collected that is distributed and shared within the control plane, such as when multiple SDN controllers exist in the architecture. </li>
            </ul>

         Compliant TOEs will implement security functionality in the following general areas. 
        <ul>
            <li>Accountability: Ensuring that information exists to discover unintentional issues with the configuration and operation of the TOE so that the root cause can be determined.</li>
            <li>Integrity: Ensuring the integrity of updates to the TOE and enforcing mechanisms that control the deployment and execution of applications running on it.</li>
            <li>Management: Providing mechanisms for configuration of the TSF and deployment of applications running on the TOE.</li>
            <li>Protected Storage: Ensuring that credentials and file system data are not subject to unauthorized disclosure.</li>
            <li>Protected Communications: Ensuring that sensitive data in transit to and from the TOE is adequately protected from unauthorized modification and disclosure.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="indexable" data-level="3" id="TOE_Boundary">1.3.1 TOE Boundary</h3>
         The TOE boundary for an SDN controller is available as a logical or a physical device. An SDN controller manages and distributes network policies, collects routing and payload information from the data plane, and interfaces with user applications in the management plane. Each plane in an SDN system is composed of multiple logical or physical components. SDN controllers logically centralize the network intelligence and state in the control plane. 
        <ul>
            <li>In a physical standalone SDN controller device, the device's hardware, firmware, and software define the evaluation boundary.</li>
            <li>In a virtual SDN controller, the software of the Virtual Machine (VM) defines the evaluation boundary.</li>
            <li>All security functionality is contained and executed within the evaluation boundary of the SDN controller.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="indexable" data-level="3" id="TOE_Platform">1.3.2 TOE Platform</h3>
         The TOE platform of a virtualized SDN controller is out of scope for this evaluation.

        Requirements in this PP-Module are designed to address the security problems in at least the following use cases. These use cases are intentionally very broad, as many specific use cases exist for an SDN controller These use cases may also overlap with one another. An SDN controller's functionality may even be effectively extended by privileged applications installed on it. However, these are out of scope of this PP.

         The SFRs included in this section are derived from Part 2 of the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, CC:2022R1, with additional extended functional components.
        <br>
        <br>
         The CC defines operations on SFRs: assignments, selections, assignments within selections and refinements. This document uses the following font conventions to identify the operations defined by the CC:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Assignments are indicated with <i>italicized</i> text.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refinements made by the PP-Module author are indicated with <b>bold text</b> for added or substituted text and <s>strikethrough</s> text for removed text. Refinements are only applied to significant technical changes to existing SFRs; minor presentation changes with no technical impact (such as British vs American spelling differences) are not marked as refinements. Refinements are also indicated when an operation is added or substituted for an existing operation (e.g. the PP-Module completes an assignment in such a way that it introduces a selection into the assignment).
                <br>
                <br>
                 Note that for SFRs that are defined either in CC Part 2 or in this PP-Module&rsquo;s Extended Components Definition, the refinement operation is used to indicate deviations from the defined component. For Base-PP SFRs that are modified by this PP-Module, the refinement operation is used to indicate deviations from the Base-PP&rsquo;s definition of the SFR (i.e. if the Base-PP refined an SFR and that change is not affected by this PP-Module, it is not shown here as a refinement).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Selections are indicated with <i>italicized</i> text.
            </li>
            <li>Iteration is indicated by appending the SFR name with a slash and unique identifier suggesting the purpose of the iteration, e.g. &lsquo;/SDN&rsquo; for an SFR relating to VPN functionality.</li>
            <li>Extended SFRs are identified by having a label &ldquo;EXT&rdquo; after the SFR name.</li>
        </ul>
         Note that selections and assignments to be completed by the ST author are preceded with &ldquo;selection:&rdquo; and &ldquo;assignment:&rdquo;. If text is italicized and does not include either of these, it means that the selection or assignment has already been completed in this PP-Module and the ST author must use the text as written. https://old.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/CPP_ND_V3.0E.pdf When this PP-Module is used to extend the NDcPP, the TOE type for the overall TOE is still a network device. The TOE boundary is simply extended to include SDN controller functionality that is provided by the network device.

        <h1 id="entropyappendix" class="indexable" data-level="A">Appendix A - Entropy Documentation and Assessment</h1>
         This appendix describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS. 
        <br>
         The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to be part of the TSS. 
        <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="entropydesign">A.1 Design Description</h2>
         Documentation will include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the product. 
        <br>
         The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if and where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged. 
        <br>
         This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. 
        <br>
         If implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included. 
        <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="entropyjustification">A.2 Entropy Justification</h2>
         There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with entropy. 
        <br>
         The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the product. 
        <br>
         For developer-provided entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of min-entropy in each output. 
        <br>
         For third-party-provided entropy sources, in which the OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to 'assume' an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular, the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST. 
        <br>
         Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete. 
        <br>
         The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts. 
        <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="entropyoperatingconditions">A.3 Operating Conditions</h2>
         The entropy rate may be affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage, frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. 
        <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="entropyhealthtesting">A.4 Health Testing</h2>
         More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.
