		This document describes a core set of high-level fundamental 
		security requirements expected of any Software Defined Networking
		(SDN) Controller for use in an enterprise. It is intended to 
		provide a minimal, baseline set of requirements which can be built
		upon by future revisions to provide an overall set of security 
		solutions for an enterprise network.
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		SDN Controllers are one of many components of an SDN networking 
		architecture. See below diagram.

      SDN Controller in relation to the SDN Planes</div>
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		An SDN Controller is a central and vital component of what 
		constitutes an SDN system and is available as a logical or a 
		physical device. An SDN Controller manages and distributes network
		policies, collects routing and payload information from the Data
		Plane, and interfaces with user applications in the Management
		Plane. Each of the planes in an SDN system is composed of multiple
		logical or physical components. SDN Controllers logically 
		centralize the network intelligence and state in the Control 
		Plane. 
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		For clarity the following definitions are provided:
		<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>
				The Control Plane is a logical entity that receives 
				instructions or requirements from the SDN Application 
				layer through its northbound interface and relays them to
				the Data Plane through its southbound interface. The 
				Controller extracts information about the network from 
				the Data Plane and communicates back to the SDN 
				Application Layer with an abstract view of the network,
				including statistics and events about what is happening.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Data Plane (or SDN Network Devices) controls the 
				forwarding and data processing capabilities for the 
				network. This includes forwarding and processing of the
				data path.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Management Plane (or SDN Applications Layer) is 
				composed of programs that communicate behaviors and 
				needed resources with the SDN Controller via application
				programming interfaces (APIs). In addition, the 
				applications can build an abstracted view of the network
				by collecting information from the Controller for 
				decision-making purposes. These applications could 
				include networking management, analytics, or business
				applications used to run large data centers. For example,
				an analytics application might be built to recognize 
				suspicious network activity for security purposes. The 
				Management Plane is sometimes also referred to as the 
				Orchestration Layer.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Data Plane and the Control Plan are decoupled so that data traffic remains in the Data Plane, and 
				control traffic remains in the Control Plan.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller has centralization of control so that all components of the SDN environment are 
				under the control of the SDN Controller only.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller can scale to manage large networks, typically spread over geographically 
				dispersed locations.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="section" id="requirements">Essential Security Requirements</div>
		The following are the essential security requirements that are 
		expected to be implemented by an SDN Controller. Note that these
		security requirements are conditional on that functionality being 
		present. For example, an SDN Controller that does not include any
		management functionality is considered to satisfy any security
		requirements that pertain to the secure use of management features.
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		Any other conditional requirements that depend on whether or not
		the product implements a certain capability are listed in the
		“Optional Extensions” section below.
		<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>
				The remote administration and audit functions shall use cryptographic algorithms to encrypt and protect communication, 
				following guidelines and recommendations from NIST SP 800-131A and its future updates to cryptographic standards and algorithms.
			</li>
			<li>
				All communications with other SDN controllers and their components must be protected and authenticated using (but not limited to)
				secure communication protocols [TLS 1.2 or higher, SSH], mutual authentication [Certificates and Public Key Infrastructure, Pre-shared Keys],
				access control [RBAC], and cryptographic algorithms [NIST SP 800-131A]. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller must have the ability to continuously monitor and log activities, as well as audit administrative actions which may include
				but not limited to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on managed devices in the fabric, logical network groups
				(including VLANs, VXLANs, and IP subnets/prefixes), routing table updates, and loss of communications to resources. The SDN controller should
				log detailed user actions, including the methods used (API, WebUI, CLI), to provide context on changes, thereby enhancing the system's traceability
				and security.  
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall provide an authentication mechanism for any users/administrators, as well as the device/VM itself that
				comply with NIST SP 800-63 and ISO/IEC 27001 and SO/IEC 27002. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller is required to implement an authorization system for any users/administrators, as well as the device/VM itself, 
				employing a RBAC or ABAC model that adheres to the principle of least privilege and that comply with NIST SP 800-53 / NIST SP 800-162. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall provide a cryptographic means to validate the source of updates to be installed on the device/VM.    
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller will enforce a policy requiring the modification of any default passwords or other credentials immediately
				upon installation. Additionally, it will compel users to create complex passwords that comply with NIST 800 63B. Beyond password
				complexity, the controller will also support multi-factor authentication (MFA) that comply NIST SP 800-63B. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall protect keys, key material, and authentication credentials from unauthorized disclosure.  
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller requires design and construction that ensures it remains operational and effective amidst cybersecurity
				threats ranging from but not limited to Malware, MitM, DoS, SQL injection, APTs, Fuzzing attacks, and HTTP-based vulnerabilities
				with robustness to maintain performance under stress and resilience for rapid recovery from attacks, safeguarding network integrity
				and minimizing disruptions. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall provide self-tests to ensure the security functions it implements are operating correctly.   
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN controller must have the ability to verify the integrity and authenticity of software updates, guarding
				against unauthorized changes, malware, and a range of cybersecurity threats.    
			</li>
			<li>
				SDN Controllers must comply with established security standards and implement best practices for API security, particularly emphasizing REST security principles. They are expected to follow guidelines set forth by recognized entities like OWASP, NIST, and ISO/IEC. This involves ensuring secure authentication, authorization, encryption, and coding practices, alongside
				conducting regular security evaluations and managing vulnerabilities to protect against current and emerging cyber threats.    
			</li>
			<li>
				By default, the SDN controllers shall enable only those services which are essential for functioning as a SDN
				controller. These shall include Northbound and southbound interfaces, remote administrative services [selection: ssh &amp; https] and assign other services as specified in the security target.
